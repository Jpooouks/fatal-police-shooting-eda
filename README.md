# Fatal Police Shooting Project

## About the Dataset
The Washington Post is compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since January 1, 2015.

In 2015, The Post began tracking more than a dozen details about each killing — including the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis — by culling local news reports, law enforcement websites and social media and by monitoring independent databases such as Killed by Police and Fatal Encounters.

The Post is documenting only those shootings in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shot and killed a civilian — the circumstances that most closely parallel the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which began the protest movement culminating in Black Lives Matter and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths.

The FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. In 2015, The Post documented more than two times more fatal shootings by police than had been recorded by the FBI.

## Conclusion
Seemingly, the biggest issue is the overly high representation of African Americans in fatal police shootings given the total black population in the US. Utilizing just these data sets, it is really difficult to establish causal relationships to explain the reason for this outcome. The hispanic population seems to undergo slight over-representation too, however it is not clear how significant it actually is. Black women seem to be the most represented racial group among women,  which would imply that perhaps the issue is racism, however it is unclear how much causal significance it is possible to derive from this particular dataset in support of the racism argument, since there could be multiple confounding variables such as living in dangerous neighborhood to give one example and no features to coroborate this question. Aditionally, 10.93% of black victims were not armed upon being shot which is nearly twice as much as the white population.<br />
The fleeing report suggests that nearly 40% of the black population was shot during fleeing. These fractions are also high in other populations with the exception of asian.
This should be further analized. Dangerous fleeing suspects could potentially do harm to others, however it also seems like there could be possibility for excessive use of force given that the officer himself is less likely to be in danger. <br />
The examination of arm categories show that a sizeable fraction of weapons that victims carried were cold weapons. That is especially true for the asian population with over 57% of the asian victims having been armed with cold weapons and 81.82% of them not fleeing the scene. This strongly suggests the possibility of the tendency to use unecessarily strong force in cases where the officer might not be in danger or where other methods of neutralization (for example tazer guns) would be sufficient force.
## Suggestion
There should be more analysis conducted in regards to black population. The case data needs to be cross-referenced with crime data of the area where the fatal shootings happened, data about the local police department, demographics of the area, political leaning of the area etc. establishing greater depth and context to the issues.<br >
The police training practices should be examined closer to discover where a possibilities for excess use of force arise and to implement measures to prevent it. One concrete area where further questions could be raised in regards to training is how optimal do police officers handle altrecation where the suspect is in posession of a cold weapon.<br>
Questions need to be raised about the handling of fleeing suspects and how it relates to current police procedures. Is there excessive force used upon fleeing suspects and if so how should the procedures be altered?
